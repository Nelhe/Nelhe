- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nelhe!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying for a master's degree in statistics.
- ğŸ‘€ I code for my studies and sometimes for fun - no, your d20 is balanced, it's in your head.
- ğŸ’» I use mostly R and Python.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a perfectionist and will not stop until every single line of text in my code is free of spelling mistakes.
